This project aims at creating a machine learning model that decides whether a subject has heart disease or not. 
In this project, we strated off with data cleaning, feature engineering and dimensionality reduction (PCA).
We then tried different machine learning methods:
1- Logestic Regression
2- KNN
3- Random Forest
4- SVM.

Due to the the relatively small size of data, we depended on cross validation in addition to grid search to get the best performance.
